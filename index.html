title: The programming language DINO
---

<p>
<em>Dino</em> is a high-level, dynamically typed, scripting language
that has been designed for simplicity, uniformity, and
expressiveness. Dino is similar to such well known scripting languages
as Python, Perl, and Lua. As most programmers know the C language,
Dino resembles C where possible.
</p>

<p>
Dino is an extensible, object oriented language that has garbage
collection. It supports parallelism description, exception handling,
pattern matching, and dynamic loading of libraries written on other
languages. Dino works on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows under CYGWIN.

<p>
Here is short code to taste Dino:

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<p>Eratosthenes sieve:</p>
<pre>
    var i, prime, count = 0, SieveSize = 8191;
    var flags = [SieveSize : 1];
    for (i = 0; i < SieveSize; i++)
      if (flags[i]) {
        prime = i + i + 3;
        flags[i + prime:SieveSize:prime] = 0;
        count++;
      }
    putln (count);




</pre>
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<p>Simple binary tree and its traversal:</p>
<pre>
    class tree {}
    class leaf (i) {use tree;} class node (l, r) {use tree;}

    fun exists_leaf (test, t) {
      pmatch (t) {
        case leaf (v): return test (v);
        case node (l, r):
          return exists_leaf (test, l) || exists_leaf (test, r);
      }
    }
    fun has_odd_leaf (t) {
      exists_leaf (fun (n) {type (n) == int && n % 2 == 1;}, t);
    }
</pre>
</div>
